Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')
  Entire assignment. However, my program has a bug in it's tokenizer and is mishandling
  numbers and symbols such as periods. The use of these in XPaths can cause a false failure. 
  I plan on correcting the tokenizer before continuing to the next milestone but unfortunately,
  it does not appear that I will accomplish this before 10:00 this evening.
  Otherwise, I believe my program is very solid. The trees returned by the parser and the comparison to 
  the Document objects appears very accurate.
  
  An example of my program's current weakness:
 	 It can handle complex XPath with nested tests just fine. Here is an example of one:
  		"/bookstore/book[title[text()="XQuery Kick Start"]][test/author[contains(text(), "James McGovern")]]"
  	It can fail on simple tests that involve the symbols it is handling incorrectly. Here is an example of one:
  		"/bookstore/book/title[text()="JK. Rowling"]"
  		
  I would appreciate it if you could consider this when constructing test cases.
